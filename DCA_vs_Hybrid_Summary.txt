        DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING vs MARKET TIMING: A DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS
                   Why "Buying the Dip" Doesn't Beat Simple DCA
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
We analyzed 462 investment scenarios using 75 years of S&P 500 data to compare 
traditional DCA against a hybrid "buy-the-dip" strategy.

RESULT: DCA wins 94% of the time.

METHODOLOGY
-----------
• 11 start periods (1950-2020)
• 7 buy days per month (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 28th)
• 6 hybrid strategies (buy dips at -5%, -10%, -15%, -20%, -25%, -30%)
• Monthly budget: $1,000
• Hybrid: 50% invested monthly, 50% held in cash at 3% until dip

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. DCA DOMINATES
   • Win Rate: 93.9% (434 out of 462 scenarios)
   • Average CAGR: 6.14% vs Hybrid 5.88%
   • Average outperformance: +0.26% annually

2. NO HYBRID STRATEGY BEATS DCA CONSISTENTLY

   Drop Threshold    Hybrid Win Rate    CAGR Difference
   -----------------------------------------------------
   5% drop                0%                -0.20%
   10% drop               0%                -0.29%
   15% drop               0%                -0.21%
   20% drop               9%                -0.26%
   25% drop               9%                -0.21%
   30% drop              18%                -0.37%

   Even the "best" hybrid (30% drop) loses 82% of the time!

3. BUY DAY DOESN'T MATTER
   • Investing on 1st vs 28th differs by only 0.01% CAGR
   • Start year matters 92x more than buy day
   • Stop trying to time purchases within the month

4. HYBRID'S ONLY BENEFIT: SLIGHTLY LOWER DRAWDOWN
   • DCA max drawdown: 46.8%
   • Hybrid max drawdown: 43.5%
   • Benefit: 3.3% less pain during crashes
   • Cost: 0.26% lower returns annually (not worth it!)

WHY HYBRID STRATEGIES FAIL
---------------------------
THE OPPORTUNITY COST PROBLEM:
• Holding 50% cash at 3% while markets grow at ~8-10% annually
• Major dips (20%+) are rare: only 3-7 events in 30 years
• Cash drag compounds over decades, overwhelming dip-buying benefits

REAL EXAMPLE (1995-2025):
• DCA: $370,000 → $1,758,866 (5.20% CAGR)
• Hybrid: $370,000 → $1,648,603 (4.98% CAGR)
• Cost of waiting: $110,263 lost

THE "11% S&P RETURN" EXPLAINED
-------------------------------
Why our CAGR (6-8%) differs from quoted "11%":

• Average Annual Return (~10-11%): Simple average of yearly returns 
  → This is what headlines quote
• Actual Market CAGR (~8-9%): Real compounded return with volatility
• DCA CAGR (~6-8%): Return on total contributions over time

The 2-3% gap is volatility drag + DCA measurement methodology.

CONCLUSION
----------
Across 462 scenarios spanning 75 years, DCA beat hybrid strategies in 94%.

✓ DO THIS:
  • Set a fixed monthly investment budget
  • Invest the full amount immediately on any convenient day
  • Stay invested through ups and downs
  • Expect 6-9% real CAGR over long periods

✗ DON'T DO THIS:
  • Wait for "dips" before investing
  • Hold cash for the "perfect entry"
  • Try to time monthly purchases

THE BOTTOM LINE: Time in the market beats timing the market. The data 
proves that trying to be clever with market timing—even with a disciplined, 
rule-based approach—costs you money. The best strategy is the simplest: 
invest consistently, invest immediately, and stay the course.
