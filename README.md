# Historical DCA vs Hybrid Strategy Analysis - S&P 500

A comprehensive data-driven analysis comparing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) against hybrid "buy-the-dip" strategies using 75 years of S&P 500 historical data (1950-2025).

## üéØ Key Finding

**DCA beats hybrid strategies in 94% of 462 tested scenarios.**

Trying to time the market by waiting for dips‚Äîeven severe 30% crashes‚Äîconsistently underperforms simple, regular investing.

## üìä Analysis Overview

We tested **462 scenarios** varying:
- **11 start periods** (1950-2020)
- **7 buy days per month** (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 28th)
- **6 hybrid strategies** (deploy cash at -5%, -10%, -15%, -20%, -25%, -30% drops)

### Strategy Comparison

**DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging):**
- Invest full monthly budget ($1,000) consistently

**Hybrid (Buy-the-Dip):**
- Invest 50% monthly ($500)
- Hold 50% in cash at 3% risk-free rate
- Deploy all cash when market drops X% from 52-week high

## üìà Results Summary

| Metric | DCA | Best Hybrid |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Win Rate** | 93.9% | 6.1% |
| **Avg CAGR** | 6.14% | 5.88% |
| **Outperformance** | +0.26% | - |

### Performance by Drop Threshold

| Drop % | Hybrid Win Rate | CAGR vs DCA |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 5% | 0% | -0.20% |
| 10% | 0% | -0.29% |
| 15% | 0% | -0.21% |
| 20% | 9% | -0.26% |
| 25% | 9% | -0.21% |
| 30% | 18% | -0.37% |

**Even waiting for 30% crashes only wins 18% of the time!**

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Buy day doesn't matter** - Investing on the 1st vs 28th differs by only 0.01% CAGR
2. **Opportunity cost kills returns** - Holding cash at 3% while markets grow at 8-10% compounds negatively
3. **Major dips are rare** - Only 3-7 events with 20%+ drops occur in 30 years
4. **Time in market > Timing the market** - Confirmed across all time periods

## üìñ Understanding the Results

### Why "11% S&P Return" vs Our 6-8% CAGR?

| Return Type | Value | What It Means |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Average Annual Return | ~10-11% | Simple arithmetic mean (what headlines quote) |
| Market CAGR | ~8-9% | Real compounded return accounting for volatility |
| DCA CAGR | ~6-8% | Return measured against total contributions over time |

The 2-3% gap is due to:
1. **Volatility drag** (CAGR < average return)
2. **DCA methodology** (comparing final value to ALL contributions, not just initial investment)

### Real Example (1995-2025)

**Scenario:** Invest $1,000/month for 30 years

| Strategy | Contributions | Final Value | CAGR |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------|
| **DCA** | $370,000 | $1,758,866 | 5.20% |
| **Hybrid (20% drop)** | $370,000 | $1,648,603 | 4.98% |

**Cost of timing:** $110,263 lost

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Source:** S&P 500 daily closing prices (1950-2025)
2. **Backtesting:** Historical simulation with no lookahead bias
3. **Hybrid Trigger Logic:**
   - Track 252-day (52-week) rolling high
   - When new high is set, "arm" the trigger
   - Deploy all cash when price drops X% from that high
   - Reset after deployment
4. **CAGR Calculation:** `(final_value / total_contributed)^(1/years) - 1`

## üìä Visualization Ideas

The data in the CSV files can be used to create:
- Heatmaps showing CAGR by start year and drop percentage
- Time series of equity curves comparing strategies
- Distribution plots of CAGR differences
- Win rate analysis by decade
