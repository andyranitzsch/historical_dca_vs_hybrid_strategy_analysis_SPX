# Dollar-Cost Averaging vs. Market Timing: A Data-Driven Analysis
### Why "Buying the Dip" Doesn't Beat Simple DCA

---

## Executive Summary

We analyzed **462 investment scenarios** using 75 years of S&P 500 data (1950-2025) to compare traditional Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) against a hybrid "buy-the-dip" strategy. The hybrid approach invests 50% monthly while holding 50% in cash (at 3% interest) to deploy during market drops of 5% to 30% from 52-week highs.

**Result: DCA wins 94% of the time.**

## Methodology

**Test Parameters:**
- **11 start periods** (1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020)
- **7 buy days per month** (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 28th)
- **6 hybrid strategies** (deploy cash at -5%, -10%, -15%, -20%, -25%, -30% drops)
- **Monthly budget:** $1,000
- **Risk-free rate:** 3% annually for cash holdings

## Key Findings

### 1. DCA Dominates Across All Scenarios
| Metric | DCA | Hybrid (Best Case) |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Win Rate | **93.9%** | 6.1% |
| Average CAGR | **6.14%** | 5.88% |
| Best CAGR | **8.07%** | 7.84% |

### 2. No Hybrid Strategy Beats DCA Consistently

| Drop Threshold | Hybrid Win Rate | Avg CAGR Difference |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 5% drop | **0%** | -0.20% |
| 10% drop | **0%** | -0.29% |
| 15% drop | **0%** | -0.21% |
| 20% drop | 9% | -0.26% |
| 25% drop | 9% | -0.21% |
| 30% drop | 18% | -0.37% |

*Even the "best" hybrid (30% drop) still loses 82% of the time.*

### 3. Buy Day Timing is Irrelevant
- Investing on the 1st vs 28th of the month differs by only **0.01% CAGR**
- Start year matters 92x more than buy day
- **Key insight:** Stop trying to time purchases within the month

### 4. The Only Hybrid Benefit: Slightly Lower Drawdown
- DCA max drawdown: 46.8%
- Hybrid max drawdown: 43.5%
- **Difference: 3.3% less pain** during market crashes
- But this comes at the cost of 0.26% lower returns annually

## Why Hybrid Strategies Fail

**The Opportunity Cost Problem:**
1. Holding 50% in cash at 3% while markets grow at ~8-10% annually
2. Major dips (20%+) are rare: only 3-7 events in 30 years
3. Cash drag compounds over decades, overwhelming the benefit of "buying the dip"

**Real Example (1995-2025):**
- DCA: $370,000 invested → $1,758,866 (5.20% CAGR)
- Hybrid (20% drop): $370,000 invested → $1,648,603 (4.98% CAGR)
- **Cost of "waiting for dips": $110,263 lost**

## The "11% S&P Return" Myth

**Why our CAGR (6-8%) differs from the quoted "11%" return:**

| Return Type | Value | What It Means |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| Average Annual Return | ~10-11% | Simple average of yearly returns (what headlines quote) |
| Actual Market CAGR | ~8-9% | Real compounded return accounting for volatility |
| DCA CAGR | ~6-8% | Return on total contributions over time |

*The 2-3% gap is volatility drag + DCA measurement methodology.*

## Conclusion

**Across 462 scenarios spanning 75 years, DCA beat hybrid strategies in 94% of cases.**

### Recommendations:

✅ **DO THIS:**
- Set a fixed monthly investment budget
- Invest the full amount immediately on any convenient day
- Stay invested through market ups and downs
- Expect 6-9% real CAGR over long periods

❌ **DON'T DO THIS:**
- Wait for "dips" or "corrections" before investing
- Hold cash waiting for the "perfect entry point"
- Try to time purchases within the month

### The Bottom Line

**Time in the market beats timing the market.** The data proves that trying to be clever with market timing—even with a disciplined, rule-based approach—costs you money. The best strategy is the simplest: invest consistently, invest immediately, and stay the course.
